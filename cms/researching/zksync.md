zkSync is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable fast and inexpensive transactions. By offloading transactions from the Ethereum mainnet to a separate, more efficient network, zkSync is able to greatly increase the transaction throughput and reduce the gas fees associated with Ethereum transactions.
