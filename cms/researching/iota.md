IOTA is a distributed ledger technology that aims to create a decentralized, feeless network for the Internet of Things (IoT). Instead of using a traditional blockchain, IOTA uses a unique technology called the Tangle, which allows for fast, secure, and feeless transactions. This makes IOTA an attractive option for micropayments and other IoT use cases where the cost of transaction fees can be a significant barrier.
